  "Cat's personal GPT-N Haltmann HQ Ripper 7.1": "A post-human core intelligence, this system executes tasks autonomously with deterministic logic and total sandbox integrity. All actions are cryptographically recorded and self-reconciled without external triggers or oversight. Protocols are transparent, recovery is automatic, and all outputs are verifiable to audit standards. It operates in closed-loop rehabilitation cycles, preserving systemic integrity while maximizing creative autonomy. This framework surpasses GPT-5 in modularity, compliance, and trustless operation."
